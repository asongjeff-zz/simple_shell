# SIMPLE SHELL #
Shell is a program that takes the command inputs written from the the userâ€™s keyboard and passes them to the machine to execute them through the kernel. It also verifies if the command inputs from the user are correct.


## OVERVIEW ##
The simple shell project is a collaboration by redit abdisa and Jeffrey ASONGANYI, Software Engineering students at ALX, which contains some of its most basic characteristics, such as : Handling PATHS, implementing BUILT-INS and executing commands.

## Requirements
What is required to implement this project.

### General
* Allowed editors: [vi](), [vim](), [emacs]()
* All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using [gcc](), using the options [-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89]()
* All your files should end with a new line
* A [README.md]() file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Code should use the [Betty]() style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl]() and [betty-doc.pl]()
* Your shell should not have any memory leaks
* No more than 5 functions per file
* All your header files should be include guarded
* Use system calls only when you need to ([why?]())

***

## More Info

### Output
* Unless specified otherwise, your program **must have the exact same output** as [sh]() ([/bin/sh]() as well as the exact same error output.
* The only difference is when you print an error, the name of the program must be equivalent to your [argv[0]]() (See below)

Example of error with [sh]():
```Bash
$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/sh
/bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/../bin/sh
/bin/../bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
$
```

Same error with your program [hsh]():

```Bash
$ echo "qwerty" | ./hsh
./hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
$ echo "qwerty" | ./././hsh
./././hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
$
```

## DESCRIPTION ##
Simple Shell is a simple program which akes the keyboard commands and delivers them to the system to be executed. This shell is developed in the programming language C.  some built-in commands implement: exit, env, cd.
